The site is live. It includes service details, an inquiry form, responsive navigation, and SEO metadata. The GitHub project tracks ongoing fixes and improvements. The image above is the site's social preview, not a screenshot of the interface.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework** - Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Language** - TypeScript
- **Styling** - CSS Modules + custom-property design tokens
- **Fonts** - Space Mono + IBM Plex Sans via `next/font`
- **Forms** - React Hook Form + Zod
- **Email** - Resend
- **Testing** - Vitest
- **Analytics** - Vercel Analytics + Speed Insights
- **Package manager** - pnpm

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Design System

Tokens live in `src/app/globals.css` under `:root` - one flat violet palette, hard
borders, zero border-radius. Two typefaces: Space Mono for UI chrome and headings,
IBM Plex Sans for prose (`--font-mono` / `--font-sans`).

Zero radius is reset once on `*`, so a component gets square corners by default
and never has to opt in.

Foreground tokens are chosen to clear **WCAG AA - 4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for
non-text UI that identifies a control**. Check every text token against
**`--surface`**, not just `--void`: `--surface` is the lighter of the two
backgrounds, so it is the worst case, and text on cards, tiles and inputs lands
there. Two exceptions, both deliberate:

- `--line` is a decorative border only (1.7:1). Anything outlining an
  interactive control uses `--line-ui` (3.4:1) instead.
- `--ink-4` sits on the AA floor at 4.8:1. Do not darken it.

Re-check all three backgrounds with a contrast checker after changing any colour.

## Project Structure

```
src/
  app/          # App Router pages, layout, OG image, sitemap, robots
  assets/fonts/ # Font binary read at build time by the OG image
  components/   # layout/, sections/, ui/
  hooks/        # Custom React hooks
  lib/          # content/, services/, inquiry/, config, seo, nav
  types/        # Ambient type declarations
public/         # Images (webp)
docs/agents/    # Agent docs
```

All user-facing copy is centralised in `src/lib/content/` and
`src/lib/services/data.ts` rather than inlined in components. That includes
`alt` text, which is copy like any other.

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the values:

```
RESEND_API_KEY=           # Resend API key for the inquiry form
CONTACT_SENDER_EMAIL=     # Address the notification is sent from
CONTACT_RECIPIENT_EMAIL=  # Address the notification is delivered to
```

`CONTACT_SENDER_EMAIL` can be omitted in development - Resend's
`onboarding@resend.dev` works without domain verification. In production it must be
a verified address on your Resend domain.

## Pre-commit Hooks

Husky runs two steps on every commit:

1. `lint-staged` - `eslint --fix` on staged JS/TS, Prettier on everything else
2. `pnpm validate` - Prettier, ESLint, `tsc --noEmit`, and a full `next build`

The production build runs on every commit, so expect commits to take a while.

## Deployment

Deployed on Vercel. Every push to `main` triggers a production deploy automatically.
